MoovSimplyIssues
================

This repository contains the issues related to MoovSimply project.

Users with write access to both can reference and close Issues back and forth across the repositories, but those without the required permissions will see references that contain a minimum of information.

For example, if you pushed a commit to the private repository's default branch with a message that read Fixes organization/public-repo#12, the issue would be closed, but only users with the proper permissions would see the cross-repository reference indicating the commit that closed the issue. Without the permissions, a reference still appears, but the details are omitted.
